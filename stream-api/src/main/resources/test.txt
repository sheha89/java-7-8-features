1 THE TEXAN
It was love at first sight.
The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.
Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The
doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat
it. If it didn't become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being short of
jaundice all the time confused them.
Each morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths and inefficient
eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duckett, one of the ward nurses who didn't like
Yossarian. They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain. They
seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.
'Still no movement?' the full colonel demanded.
The doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.
'Give him another pill.'
Nurse Duckett made a note to give Yossarian another pill, and the four of them moved along to the
next bed. None of the nurses liked Yossarian. Actually, the pain in his liver had gone away, but
Yossarian didn't say anything and the doctors never suspected. They just suspected that he had been
moving his bowels and not telling anyone.
Yossarian had everything he wanted in the hospital. The food wasn't too bad, and his meals were
brought to him in bed. There were extra rations of fresh meat, and during the hot part of the
afternoon he and the others were served chilled fruit juice or chilled chocolate milk. Apart from the
doctors and the nurses, no one ever disturbed him. For a little while in the morning he had to censor
letters, but he was free after that to spend the rest of each day lying around idly with a clear
conscience. He was comfortable in the hospital, and it was easy to stay on because he always ran a
temperature of 101. He was even more comfortable than Dunbar, who had to keep falling down on
his face in order to get his meals brought to him in bed.
After he had made up his mind to spend the rest of the war in the hospital, Yossarian wrote letters to
everyone he knew saying that he was in the hospital but never mentioning why. One day he had a
better idea. To everyone he knew he wrote that he was going on a very dangerous mission. 'They
asked for volunteers. It's very dangerous, but someone has to do it. I'll write you the instant I get
back.' And he had not written anyone since.
All the officer patients in the ward were forced to censor letters written by all the enlisted-men
patients, who were kept in residence in wards of their own. It was a monotonous job, and Yossarian
was disappointed to learn that the lives of enlisted men were only slightly more interesting than the
lives of officers. After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented
games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his 
hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a
much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but
a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case
left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and
leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation 'Dear Mary' from a letter,
and at the bottom he wrote, 'I yearn for you tragically. R. O. Shipman, Chaplain, U.S. Army.' R.O.
Shipman was the group chaplain's name.
When he had exhausted all possibilities in the letters, he began attacking the names and addresses
on the envelopes, obliterating whole homes and streets, annihilating entire metropolises with
careless flicks of his wrist as though he were God. Catch-22 required that each censored letter bear
the censoring officer's name. Most letters he didn't read at all. On those he didn't read at all he
wrote his own name. On those he did read he wrote, 'Washington Irving.' When that grew
monotonous he wrote, 'Irving Washington.' Censoring the envelopes had serious repercussions,
produced a ripple of anxiety on some ethereal military echelon that floated a C.I.D. man back into
the ward posing as a patient. They all knew he was a C.I.D. man because he kept inquiring about an
officer named Irving or Washington and because after his first day there he wouldn't censor letters.
He found them too monotonous.
It was a good ward this time, one of the best he and Dunbar had ever enjoyed. With them this time
was the twenty-four-year-old fighter-pilot captain with the sparse golden mustache who had been
shot into the Adriatic Sea in midwinter and not even caught cold. Now the summer was upon them,
the captain had not been shot down, and he said he had the grippe. In the bed on Yossarian's right,
still lying amorously on his belly, was the startled captain with malaria in his blood and a mosquito
bite on his ass. Across the aisle from Yossarian was Dunbar, and next to Dunbar was the artillery
captain with whom Yossarian had stopped playing chess. The captain was a good chess player, and
the games were always interesting. Yossarian had stopped playing chess with him because the
games were so interesting they were foolish. Then there was the educated Texan from Texas who
looked like someone in Technicolor and felt, patriotically, that people of means - decent folk -
should be given more votes than drifters, whores, criminals, degenerates, atheists and indecent folk
- people without means.
Yossarian was unspringing rhythms in the letters the day they brought the Texan in. It was another
quiet, hot, untroubled day. The heat pressed heavily on the roof, stifling sound. Dunbar was lying
motionless on his back again with his eyes staring up at the ceiling like a doll's. He was working
hard at increasing his life span. He did it by cultivating boredom. Dunbar was working so hard at
increasing his life span that Yossarian thought he was dead. They put the Texan in a bed in the
middle of the ward, and it wasn't long before he donated his views.
Dunbar sat up like a shot. 'That's it,' he cried excitedly. 'There was something missing - all the time 
I knew there was something missing - and now I know what it is.' He banged his fist down into his
palm. 'No patriotism,' he declared.
'You're right,' Yossarian shouted back. 'You're right, you're right, you're right. The hot dog, the
Brooklyn Dodgers. Mom's apple pie. That's what everyone's fighting for. But who's fighting for the
decent folk? Who's fighting for more votes for the decent folk? There's no patriotism, that's what it
is. And no matriotism, either.'
The warrant officer on Yossarian's left was unimpressed. 'Who gives a shit?' he asked tiredly, and
turned over on his side to go to sleep.
The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand
him.
He sent shudders of annoyance scampering up ticklish spines, and everybody fled from him -
everybody but the soldier in white, who had no choice. The soldier in white was encased from head
to toe in plaster and gauze. He had two useless legs and two useless arms. He had been smuggled
into the ward during the night, and the men had no idea he was among them until they awoke in the
morning and saw the two strange legs hoisted from the hips, the two strange arms anchored up
perpendicularly, all four limbs pinioned strangely in air by lead weights suspended darkly above
him that never moved. Sewn into the bandages over the insides of both elbows were zippered lips
through which he was fed clear fluid from a clear jar. A silent zinc pipe rose from the cement on his
groin and was coupled to a slim rubber hose that carried waste from his kidneys and dripped it
efficiently into a clear, stoppered jar on the floor. When the jar on the floor was full, the jar feeding
his elbow was empty, and the two were simply switched quickly so that the stuff could drip back
into him. All they ever really saw of the soldier in white was a frayed black hole over his mouth.
The soldier in white had been filed next to the Texan, and the Texan sat sideways on his own bed
and talked to him throughout the morning, afternoon and evening in a pleasant, sympathetic drawl.
The Texan never minded that he got no reply.
Temperatures were taken twice a day in the ward. Early each morning and late each afternoon
Nurse Cramer entered with a jar full of thermometers and worked her way up one side of the ward
and down the other, distributing a thermometer to each patient. She managed the soldier in white by
inserting a thermometer into the hole over his mouth and leaving it balanced there on the lower rim.
When she returned to the man in the first bed, she took his thermometer and recorded his
temperature, and then moved on to the next bed and continued around the ward again. One
afternoon when she had completed her first circuit of the ward and came a second time to the
soldier in white, she read his thermometer and discovered that he was dead.
'Murderer,' Dunbar said quietly.
The Texan looked up at him with an uncertain grin.
'Killer,' Yossarian said. 
What are you fellas talkin' about?' the Texan asked nervously.
'You murdered him,' said Dunbar.
'You killed him,' said Yossarian.
The Texan shrank back. 'You fellas are crazy. I didn't even touch him.'
'You murdered him,' said Dunbar.
'I heard you kill him,' said Yossarian.
'You killed him because he was a nigger,' Dunbar said.
'You fellas are crazy,' the Texan cried. 'They don't allow niggers in here. They got a special place
for niggers.'
'The sergeant smuggled him in,' Dunbar said.
'The Communist sergeant,' said Yossarian.
'And you knew it.'
The warrant officer on Yossarian's left was unimpressed by the entire incident of the soldier in
white. The warrant officer was unimpressed by everything and never spoke at all unless it was to
show irritation.
The day before Yossarian met the chaplain, a stove exploded in the mess hall and set fire to one
side of the kitchen. An intense heat flashed through the area. Even in Yossarian's ward, almost three
hundred feet away, they could hear the roar of the blaze and the sharp cracks of flaming timber.
Smoke sped past the orange-tinted windows. In about fifteen minutes the crash trucks from the
airfield arrived to fight the fire. For a frantic half hour it was touch and go. Then the firemen began
to get the upper hand. Suddenly there was the monotonous old drone of bombers returning from a
mission, and the firemen had to roll up their hoses and speed back to the field in case one of the
planes crashed and caught fire. The planes landed safely. As soon as the last one was down, the
firemen wheeled their trucks around and raced back up the hill to resume their fight with the fire at
the hospital. When they got there, the blaze was out. It had died of its own accord, expired
completely without even an ember to be watered down, and there was nothing for the disappointed
firemen to do but drink tepid coffee and hang around trying to screw the nurses.
The chaplain arrived the day after the fire. Yossarian was busy expurgating all but romance words
from the letters when the chaplain sat down in a chair between the beds and asked him how he was
feeling. He had placed himself a bit to one side, and the captain's bars on the tab of his shirt collar
were all the insignia Yossarian could see. Yossarian had no idea who he was and just took it for
granted that he was either another doctor or another madman.
'Oh, pretty good,' he answered. 'I've got a slight pain in my liver and I haven't been the most regular
of fellows, I guess, but all in all I must admit that I feel pretty good.'
'That's good,' said the chaplain.
'Yes,' Yossarian said. 'Yes, that is good.' 
'I meant to come around sooner,' the chaplain said, 'but I really haven't been well.'
'That's too bad,' Yossarian said.
'Just a head cold,' the chaplain added quickly.
'I've got a fever of a hundred and one,' Yossarian added just as quickly.
'That's too bad,' said the chaplain.
'Yes,' Yossarian agreed. 'Yes, that is too bad.'
The chaplain fidgeted. 'Is there anything I can do for you?' he asked after a while.
'No, no.' Yossarian sighed. 'The doctors are doing all that's humanly possible, I suppose.'
'No, no.' The chaplain colored faintly. 'I didn't mean anything like that. I meant cigarettes... or
books... or... toys.'
'No, no,' Yossarian said. 'Thank you. I have everything I need, I suppose - everything but good
health.'
'That's too bad.'
'Yes,' Yossarian said. 'Yes, that is too bad.'
The chaplain stirred again. He looked from side to side a few times, then gazed up at the ceiling,
then down at the floor. He drew a deep breath.
'Lieutenant Nately sends his regards,' he said.
Yossarian was sorry to hear they had a mutual friend. It seemed there was a basis to their
conversation after all. 'You know Lieutenant Nately?' he asked regretfully.
'Yes, I know Lieutenant Nately quite well.'
'He's a bit loony, isn't he?'
The chaplain's smile was embarrassed. 'I'm afraid I couldn't say. I don't think I know him that well.'
'You can take my word for it,' Yossarian said. 'He's as goofy as they come.'
The chaplain weighed the next silence heavily and then shattered it with an abrupt question. 'You
are Captain Yossarian, aren't you?'
'Nately had a bad start. He came from a good family.'
'Please excuse me,' the chaplain persisted timorously. 'I may be committing a very grave error. Are
you Captain Yossarian?'
'Yes,' Captain Yossarian confessed. 'I am Captain Yossarian.'
'Of the 256th Squadron?'
'Of the fighting 256th Squadron,' Yossarian replied. 'I didn't know there were any other Captain
Yossarians. As far as I know, I'm the only Captain Yossarian I know, but that's only as far as I
know.'
'I see,' the chaplain said unhappily.
'That's two to the fighting eighth power,' Yossarian pointed out, 'if you're thinking of writing a
symbolic poem about our squadron.' 
'No,' mumbled the chaplain. 'I'm not thinking of writing a symbolic poem about your squadron.'
Yossarian straightened sharply when he spied the tiny silver cross on the other side of the chaplain's
collar. He was thoroughly astonished, for he had never really talked with a chaplain before.
'You're a chaplain,' he exclaimed ecstatically. 'I didn't know you were a chaplain.'
'Why, yes,' the chaplain answered. 'Didn't you know I was a chaplain?'
'Why, no. I didn't know you were a chaplain.' Yossarian stared at him with a big, fascinated grin.
'I've never really seen a chaplain before.'
The chaplain flushed again and gazed down at his hands. He was a slight man of about thirty-two
with tan hair and brown diffident eyes. His face was narrow and rather pale. An innocent nest of
ancient pimple pricks lay in the basin of each cheek. Yossarian wanted to help him.
'Can I do anything at all to help you?' the chaplain asked.
Yossarian shook his head, still grinning. 'No, I'm sorry. I have everything I need and I'm quite
comfortable. In fact, I'm not even sick.'
'That's good.' As soon as the chaplain said the words, he was sorry and shoved his knuckles into his
mouth with a giggle of alarm, but Yossarian remained silent and disappointed him. 'There are other
men in the group I must visit,' he apologized finally. 'I'll come to see you again, probably
tomorrow.'
'Please do that,' Yossarian said.
'I'll come only if you want me to,' the chaplain said, lowering his head shyly. 'I've noticed that I
make many of the men uncomfortable.'
Yossarian glowed with affection. 'I want you to,' he said. 'You won't make me uncomfortable.'
The chaplain beamed gratefully and then peered down at a slip of paper he had been concealing in
his hand all the while. He counted along the beds in the ward, moving his lips, and then centered
his attention dubiously on Dunbar.
'May I inquire,' he whispered softly, 'if that is Lieutenant Dunbar?'
'Yes,' Yossarian answered loudly, 'that is Lieutenant Dunbar.'
'Thank you,' the chaplain whispered. 'Thank you very much. I must visit with him. I must visit with
every member of the group who is in the hospital.'
'Even those in other wards?' Yossarian asked.
'Even those in other wards.'
'Be careful in those other wards, Father,' Yossarian warned. 'That's where they keep the mental
cases. They're filled with lunatics.'
'It isn't necessary to call me Father,' the chaplain explained. 'I'm an Anabaptist.'
'I'm dead serious about those other wards,' Yossarian continued grimly. 'M.P.s won't protect you,
because they're craziest of all. I'd go with you myself, but I'm scared stiff: Insanity is contagious.
This is the only sane ward in the whole hospital. Everybody is crazy but us. This is probably the 
only sane ward in the whole world, for that matter.'
The chaplain rose quickly and edged away from Yossarian's bed, and then nodded with a
conciliating smile and promised to conduct himself with appropriate caution. 'And now I must visit
with Lieutenant Dunbar,' he said. Still he lingered, remorsefully. 'How is Lieutenant Dunbar?' he
asked at last.
'As good as they go,' Yossarian assured him. 'A true prince. One of the finest, least dedicated men in
the whole world.'
'I didn't mean that,' the chaplain answered, whispering again. 'Is he very sick?'
'No, he isn't very sick. In fact, he isn't sick at all.'
'That's good.' The chaplain sighed with relief.
'Yes,' Yossarian said. 'Yes, that is good.'
'A chaplain,' Dunbar said when the chaplain had visited him and gone. 'Did you see that? A
chaplain.'
'Wasn't he sweet?' said Yossarian. 'Maybe they should give him three votes.'
'Who's they?' Dunbar demanded suspiciously.
In a bed in the small private section at the end of the ward, always working ceaselessly behind the
green plyboard partition, was the solemn middle-aged colonel who was visited every day by a
gentle, sweet-faced woman with curly ash-blond hair who was not a nurse and not a Wac and not a
Red Cross girl but who nevertheless appeared faithfully at the hospital in Pianosa each afternoon
wearing pretty pastel summer dresses that were very smart and white leather pumps with heels half
high at the base of nylon seams that were inevitably straight. The colonel was in Communications,
and he was kept busy day and night transmitting glutinous messages from the interior into square
pads of gauze which he sealed meticulously and delivered to a covered white pail that stood on the
night table beside his bed. The colonel was gorgeous. He had a cavernous mouth, cavernous cheeks,
cavernous, sad, mildewed eyes. His face was the color of clouded silver. He coughed quietly,
gingerly, and dabbed the pads slowly at his lips with a distaste that had become automatic.
The colonel dwelt in a vortex of specialists who were still specializing in trying to determine what
was troubling him. They hurled lights in his eyes to see if he could see, rammed needles into nerves
to hear if he could feel. There was a urologist for his urine, a lymphologist for his lymph, an
endocrinologist for his endocrines, a psychologist for his psyche, a dermatologist for his derma;
there was a pathologist for his pathos, a cystologist for his cysts, and a bald and pedantic cetologist
from the zoology department at Harvard who had been shanghaied ruthlessly into the Medical
Corps by a faulty anode in an I.B.M. machine and spent his sessions with the dying colonel trying
to discuss Moby Dick with him.
The colonel had really been investigated. There was not an organ of his body that had not been
drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed, removed, plundered and 
replaced. Neat, slender and erect, the woman touched him often as she sat by his bedside and was
the epitome of stately sorrow each time she smiled. The colonel was tall, thin and stooped. When
he rose to walk, he bent forward even more, making a deep cavity of his body, and placed his feet
down very carefully, moving ahead by inches from the knees down. There were violet pools under
his eyes. The woman spoke softly, softer than the colonel coughed, and none of the men in the ward
ever heard her voice.
In less than ten days the Texan cleared the ward. The artillery captain broke first, and after that the
exodus started. Dunbar, Yossarian and the fighter captain all bolted the same morning. Dunbar
stopped having dizzy spells, and the fighter captain blew his nose. Yossarian told the doctors that
the pain in his liver had gone away. It was as easy as that. Even the warrant officer fled. In less than
ten days, the Texan drove everybody in the ward back to duty - everybody but the C.I.D. man, who
had caught cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.
2 CLEVINGER
In a way the C.I.D. man was pretty lucky, because outside the hospital the war was still going on.
Men went mad and were rewarded with medals. All over the world, boys on every side of the bomb
line were laying down their lives for what they had been told was their country, and no one seemed
to mind, least of all the boys who were laying down their young lives. There was no end in sight.
The only end in sight was Yossarian's own, and he might have remained in the hospital until
doomsday had it not been for that patriotic Texan with his infundibuliform jowls and his lumpy,
rumpleheaded, indestructible smile cracked forever across the front of his face like the brim of a
black ten-gallon hat. The Texan wanted everybody in the ward to be happy but Yossarian and
Dunbar. He was really very sick.
But Yossarian couldn't be happy, even though the Texan didn't want him to be, because outside the
hospital there was still nothing funny going on. The only thing going on was a war, and no one
seemed to notice but Yossarian and Dunbar. And when Yossarian tried to remind people, they drew
away from him and thought he was crazy. Even Clevinger, who should have known better but didn't,
had told him he was crazy the last time they had seen each other, which was just before Yossarian
had fled into the hospital.
Clevinger had stared at him with apoplectic rage and indignation and, clawing the table with both
hands, had shouted, 'You're crazy!'
'Clevinger, what do you want from people?' Dunbar had replied wearily above the noises of the
officers' club.
'I'm not joking,' Clevinger persisted.
'They're trying to kill me,' Yossarian told him calmly.
'No one's trying to kill you,' Clevinger cried.
'Then why are they shooting at me?' Yossarian asked. 
'They're shooting at everyone,' Clevinger answered. 'They're trying to kill everyone.'
'And what difference does that make?'
Clevinger was already on the way, half out of his chair with emotion, his eyes moist and his lips
quivering and pale. As always occurred when he quarreled over principles in which he believed
passionately, he would end up gasping furiously for air and blinking back bitter tears of conviction.
There were many principles in which Clevinger believed passionately. He was crazy.
'Who's they?' he wanted to know. 'Who, specifically, do you think is trying to murder you?'
'Every one of them,' Yossarian told him.
'Every one of whom?'
'Every one of whom do you think?'
'I haven't any idea.'
'Then how do you know they aren't?'
'Because...' Clevinger sputtered, and turned speechless with frustration.
Clevinger really thought he was right, but Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know
shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't
funny at all. And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier. There was
nothing funny about living like a bum in a tent in Pianosa between fat mountains behind him and a
placid blue sea in front that could gulp down a person with a cramp in the twinkling of an eye and
ship him back to shore three days later, all charges paid, bloated, blue and putrescent, water
draining out through both cold nostrils.
The tent he lived in stood right smack up against the wall of the shallow, dull-colored forest
separating his own squadron from Dunbar's. Immediately alongside was the abandoned railroad
ditch that carried the pipe that carried the aviation gasoline down to the fuel trucks at the airfield.
Thanks to Orr, his roommate, it was the most luxurious tent in the squadron. Each time Yossarian
returned from one of his holidays in the hospital or rest leaves in Rome, he was surprised by some
new comfort Orr had installed in his absence - running water, wood-burning fireplace, cement floor.
Yossarian had chosen the site, and he and Orr had raised the tent together. Orr, who was a grinning
pygmy with pilot's wings and thick, wavy brown hair parted in the middle, furnished all the
knowledge, while Yossarian, who was taller, stronger, broader and faster, did most of the work. Just
the two of them lived there, although the tent was big enough for six. When summer came, Orr
rolled up the side flaps to allow a breeze that never blew to flush away the air baking inside.
Immediately next door to Yossarian was Havermeyer, who liked peanut brittle and lived all by
himself in the two-man tent in which he shot tiny field mice every night with huge bullets from
the .45 he had stolen from the dead man in Yossarian's tent. On the other side of Havermeyer stood
the tent McWatt no longer shared with Clevinger, who had still not returned when Yossarian came
out of the hospital. McWatt shared his tent now with Nately, who was away in Rome courting the 
sleepy whore he had fallen so deeply in love with there who was bored with her work and bored
with him too. McWatt was crazy. He was a pilot and flew his plane as low as he dared over
Yossarian's tent as often as he could, just to see how much he could frighten him, and loved to go
buzzing with a wild, close roar over the wooden raft floating on empty oil drums out past the sand
bar at the immaculate white beach where the men went swimming naked. Sharing a tent with a man
who was crazy wasn't easy, but Nately didn't care. He was crazy, too, and had gone every free day
to work on the officers' club that Yossarian had not helped build.
Actually, there were many officers' clubs that Yossarian had not helped build, but he was proudest
of the one on Pianosa. It was a sturdy and complex monument to his powers of determination.
Yossarian never went there to help until it was finished; then he went there often, so pleased was he
with the large, fine, rambling, shingled building. It was truly a splendid structure, and Yossarian
throbbed with a mighty sense of accomplishment each time he gazed at it and reflected that none of
the work that had gone into it was his.
There were four of them seated together at a table in the officers' club the last time he and
Clevinger had called each other crazy. They were seated in back near the crap table on which
Appleby always managed to win. Appleby was as good at shooting crap as he was at playing
ping-pong, and he was as good at playing ping-pong as he was at everything else. Everything
Appleby did, he did well. Appleby was a fair-haired boy from Iowa who believed in God,
Motherhood and the American Way of Life, without ever thinking about any of them, and
everybody who knew him liked him.
'I hate that son of a bitch,' Yossarian growled.
The argument with Clevinger had begun a few minutes earlier when Yossarian had been unable to
find a machine gun. It was a busy night. The bar was busy, the crap table was busy, the ping-gong
table was busy. The people Yossarian wanted to machine-gun were busy at the bar singing
sentimental old favorites that nobody else ever tired of. Instead of machine-gunning them, he
brought his heel down hard on the ping-pong ball that came rolling toward him off the paddle of
one of the two officers playing.
'That Yossarian,' the two officers laughed, shaking their heads, and got another ball from the box on
the shelf.
'That Yossarian,' Yossarian answered them.
'Yossarian,' Nately whispered cautioningly.
'You see what I mean?' asked Clevinger.
The officers laughed again when they heard Yossarian mimicking them. 'That Yossarian,' they said
more loudly.
'That Yossarian,' Yossarian echoed.
'Yossarian, please,' Nately pleaded. 
'You see what I mean?' asked Clevinger. 'He has antisocial aggressions.'
'Oh, shut up,' Dunbar told Clevinger. Dunbar liked Clevinger because Clevinger annoyed him and
made the time go slow.
'Appleby isn't even here,' Clevinger pointed out triumphantly to Yossarian.
'Who said anything about Appleby?' Yossarian wanted to know.
'Colonel Cathcart isn't here, either.'
'Who said anything about Colonel Cathcart?'
'What son of a bitch do you hate, then?'
'What son of a bitch is here?'
'I'm not going to argue with you,' Clevinger decided. 'You don't know who you hate.'
'Whoever's trying to poison me,' Yossarian told him.
'Nobody's trying to poison you.'
'They poisoned my food twice, didn't they? Didn't they put poison in my food during Ferrara and
during the Great Big Siege of Bologna?'
'They put poison in everybody's food,' Clevinger explained.
'And what difference does that make?'
'And it wasn't even poison!' Clevinger cried heatedly, growing more emphatic as he grew more
confused.
As far back as Yossarian could recall, he explained to Clevinger with a patient smile, somebody
was always hatching a plot to kill him. There were people who cared for him and people who didn't,
and those who didn't hated him and were out to get him. They hated him because he was Assyrian.
But they couldn't touch him, he told Clevinger, because he had a sound mind in a pure body and
was as strong as an ox. They couldn't touch him because he was Tarzan, Mandrake, Flash Gordon.
He was Bill Shakespeare. He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom,
Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees. He was miracle ingredient Z-247.
He was -
'Crazy!' Clevinger interrupted, shrieking. 'That's what you are! Crazy!
'- immense. I'm a real, slam-bang, honest-to-goodness, three-fisted humdinger. I'm a bona fide
supraman.'
'Superman?' Clevinger cried. 'Superman?'
'Supraman,' Yossarian corrected.
'Hey, fellas, cut it out,' Nately begged with embarrassment. 'Everybody's looking at us.'
'You're crazy,' Clevinger shouted vehemently, his eyes filling with tears. 'You've got a Jehovah
complex.'
'I think everyone is Nathaniel.'
Clevinger arrested himself in mid-declamation, suspiciously. 'Who's Nathaniel?' 
'Nathaniel who?' inquired Yossarian innocently.
Clevinger skirted the trap neatly. 'You think everybody is Jehovah. You're no better than
Raskolnkov -'
'Who?'
'- yes, Raskolnikov, who -'
'Raskolnikov!'
'- who - I mean it - who felt he could justify killing an old woman -'
'No better than?'
'- yes, justify, that's right - with an ax! And I can prove it to you!' Gasping furiously for air,
Clevinger enumerated Yossarian's symptoms: an unreasonable belief that everybody around him
was crazy, a homicidal impulse to machine-gun strangers, retrospective falsification, an unfounded
suspicion that people hated him and were conspiring to kill him.
But Yossarian knew he was right, because, as he explained to Clevinger, to the best of his
knowledge he had never been wrong. Everywhere he looked was a nut, and it was all a sensible
young gentleman like himself could do to maintain his perspective amid so much madness. And it
was urgent that he did, for he knew his life was in peril.
Yossarian eyed everyone he saw warily when he returned to the squadron from the hospital. Milo
was away, too, in Smyrna for the fig harvest. The mess hall ran smoothly in Milo's absence.
Yossarian had responded ravenously to the pungent aroma of spicy lamb while he was still in the
cab of the ambulance bouncing down along the knotted road that lay like a broken suspender
between the hospital and the squadron. There was shish-kabob for lunch, huge, savory hunks of
spitted meat sizzling like the devil over charcoal after marinating seventy-two hours in a secret
mixture Milo had stolen from a crooked trader in the Levant, served with Iranian rice and asparagus
tips Parmesan, followed by cherries jubilee for dessert and then steaming cups of fresh coffee with
Benedictine and brandy. The meal was served in enormous helpings on damask tablecloths by the
skilled Italian waiters Major - de Coverley had kidnaped from the mainland and given to Milo.
Yossarian gorged himself in the mess hall until he thought he would explode and then sagged back
in a contented stupor, his mouth filmy with a succulent residue. None of the officers in the
squadron had ever eaten so well as they ate regularly in Milo's mess hall, and Yossarian wondered
awhile if it wasn't perhaps all worth it. But then he burped and remembered that they were trying to
kill him, and he sprinted out of the mess hall wildly and ran looking for Doc Daneeka to have
himself taken off combat duty and sent home. He found Doc Daneeka in sunlight, sitting on a high
stool outside his tent.
'Fifty missions,' Doc Daneeka told him, shaking his head. 'The colonel wants fifty missions.'
'But I've only got forty-four!'
Doc Daneeka was unmoved. He was a sad, birdlike man with the spatulate face and scrubbed, 
tapering features of a well-groomed rat.
'Fifty missions,' he repeated, still shaking his head. 'The colonel wants fifty missions.'
