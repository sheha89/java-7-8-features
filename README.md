# Experiments with Java 7 and 8 features

## Java 7 features

- String literals
- String Switch
- Try with resource statement
- PreparedStatement
- TypeInference

## Java 8 features
- Annotations
- Date time api
- Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
- Lambda expressions
- Method references
- Streams
- Functional interfaces
- Map extensions

## Test Driven development with
- Mokito
- Junit

# Notes

### Annotations can be used in
- Receivers
- Type Casting
- Inheritance
- Creation of new objects
- Generics and Arrays

### Can do arithmetic operations on values ```int 0 – 2^32``` and ```long 0 – 2^64``` respectively.


###Contracts of Function/Method

- Function/Methods should not modify shared mutable states.
- Function/Methods should not modify input parameters.
- Function/Methods should not do harm to the world.
- Function/Methods should not change the execution flow (Exceptions must be returned as data not thrown).

### Stream API
- An API to perform common functionalities in Java in a Declarative manner as opposed to the Imperative.
- Improves performance by using Immutability and Lazy processing.
- Simplifies Java code understanding and readability.
- Encapsulates implementation logic and eases parallelization.
